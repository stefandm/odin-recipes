    <h1>Como un vero italiano</h1>
    <p>C'mon friend, don't push it</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil </li>
        <li>400g/14oz beef mince</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced </li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped </li>
        <li>100g/3Â½oz carrot, grated</li>
        <li>2 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>400ml stock</li>
        <li>400g/14oz dried spaghetti</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and once hot add the beef mince and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook the mince until well browned over a medium-high heat (be careful not to burn the mince. It just needs to be a dark brown colour). Once browned, transfer the mince to a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the saucepan you browned the mince in and turn the heat to medium. Add the onions and a pinch of salt and fry gently for 5-6 minutes, or until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the grated carrot then pour the mince and any juices in the bowl back into the saucepan.</li>    
        <li>Add the tomatoes to the pan and stir well to mix. Pour in the stock, bring to a simmer and then reduce the temperature to simmer gently for 45 minutes, or until the sauce is thick and rich. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary.</li>  
        <li>When ready to cook the spaghetti, heat a large saucepan of water and add a pinch of salt. Cook according to the packet instructions. Once the spaghetti is cooked through, drain and add to the pan with the bolognese sauce. Mix well and serve.</li> 
    </ul>
